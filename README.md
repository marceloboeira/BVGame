## Motivation

The ideia is to learn more about functional programming & front-end applications with Elm.

### The Game

The game is about Subway Stations and Lines from the Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe [BVG](https://www.bvg.de/en). The players must guess at least one train Line that cross a given station.

## Changelog
> See what changed over time

### v0.0.1 - First "playbable"

Up to this point the game is quite raw:

1. You load the page
2. Click start
3. See the Statation
4. Select one of the 9 possible U-Bahn lines
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for 5 rounds
6. See a "end-game" screen with your score

Limitations:

* Only 6 stations are available
* The stations always appear in the same order
* No support for mobile devices / screen sizes

Technically:

* No significant abstractions, mainly adding everyting to "Application.elm"
* No significant testing, only some samples to learn about `elm-explorations/test`.
* No CSS/JS pipeline (uglify/minimize)
* No HTML/CSS optmizations
