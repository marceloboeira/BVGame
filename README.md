> An non-official BVG Stations Game

## Motivation

The ideia is to learn more about functional programming & front-end applications with Elm.

### The Game

The game is about Subway Stations and Lines from the Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe [BVG](https://www.bvg.de/en). The players must guess at least one train Line that cross a given station.
